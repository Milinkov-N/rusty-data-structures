# Data Structures educational crate

This crate exists solely for educational purposes and also as
a portfolio project.

It is not designed for production use, in a pinch it is suitable for use in
other educational or small pet projects.

This crate touches not only the topic of data structures, but all the basics
of Rust Language such as:

- Pointers and Smart Pointers: `&`, `&mut`, `Box`, `Rc`, `Arc`, `*const`,
  `*mut`

- Ownership model, borrowing concept, inherited mutability, interior mutability,
  Copy

- All the keywords: `struct`, `enum`, `fn`, `pub`, `impl`, `use` and such

- Pattern matching, generics, destructors and testing

## Todo

1. Add docs to currently implmented Linked and Persistent Lists
2. Add to readme file some thoughts about linked lists
3. Expand functionality of currently implmented lists
4. Add simple GitHub workflow on pull requests into master branch
